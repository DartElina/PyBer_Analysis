# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of the new analysis.

The aim of the assignment is to use Python and Pandas to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type and submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.



## Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
